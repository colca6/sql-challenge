# sql-challenge
Module 9 homework

I use Cognos BI (IBM) at work at a large healthcare company.  Though mostly using a GUI, I essentially build SQL statements, which run and produce reports, mainly in Excel.  Therefore, of all the things we have used thusfar in the bootcamp, SQL is probably strongest for me.

Now SQL alchemy will be a different story.

Creating the database schema was not difficult, just used my experience and common sense. 

Table creation scripts straightforward.  I did get stuck on loading the data from csv files.  I was trying to use "copy" in SQL, but it was telling me "access denied" or some variation of that, couldn't read files.

Called BCS Assistant who showed me a way to do it quickly and simply using the pgAdmin gui. Right click on table name, enter path to csv file in "Filename" field, include headers, then one button loading!  Yay BCS!

I found the SQL queries straightforward as well, due to my experience. I don't do many complex things like subqueries, but not necessary here.
